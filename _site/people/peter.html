    <h1>Peter F. Barker</h1>
<h2>Professor, Group Leader</h2>

<p>Peter Barker is a professor of Physics at University College London since 2007. He has a background in cold atomic and molecular physics. His current research interest is in levitated optomechanical systems. His goal is to exploit these systems to advance our understanding of Quantum Mechanics, as well as utilising these systems in experiments requiring high sensitivity such as dark matter searches and inertial force-sensing.</p>
